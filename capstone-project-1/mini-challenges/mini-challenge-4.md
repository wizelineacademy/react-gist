# Mini-Challenge 4: State Management

## The Challenge
1. Create the Provider for the Global Context.
2. **Consume the Global Context inside the components that require it:** Remember the hook `useContext`? It's time to make use of it!
3. Create test cases for your Global Context and for the components that consume it.

> **Note:* Remember to apply TDD as much as you can.*

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The search term is stored and retrieved from the Global Context correctly.
- [ ] The appearance theme is stored on the Global Context and applied correctly to the App UI.
- [ ] `useReducer` hook is implemented correctly to manage the Global State.

## Bonus Points
- [ ] Testing coverage is above 70%. (Please include a screenshot of the code coverage report in your PR description).
